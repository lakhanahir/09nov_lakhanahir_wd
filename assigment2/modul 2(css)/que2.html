          <h1>ANS:</h1>
            Unlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle. 
            With CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast.
