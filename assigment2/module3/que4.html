            SVG<br><br>
               SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.  <br>             
                   SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.<br>
	               SVG can be modified through script and CSS.<br>
	               SVG is vector based and composed of shapes.<br><br>
                 
       canvas<br><br>
         Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.<br>   
                   Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.<br>     
                   Canvas can be modified through script only<br>
                   Canvas is raster based and composed of pixel.
